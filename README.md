# Rain in Australia
Creating neural networks to predict next-day rain in Australia. Using the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

Implementation of a Fully Connected Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (a type of Recurrent Neural Network) can be found in FCNN.ipynb and LSTM.ipynb accordingly.

To run, simply download and run the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb files) locally using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/index.html), or online using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code) or [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).
